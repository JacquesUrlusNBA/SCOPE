# SCOPE

According to the document “Regelgevende Technische Standaard (RTS) van het SBR-domein Handelsregister”, Article 4c, organizations that prepare their annual accounts on the basis of so-called “Other GAAP” (as referred to in Article 2:362 paragraph 1, second sentence of the Dutch Civil Code) are only required to include the mandatory markup as specified in Annex II.

To facilitate this, a dedicated entry point has been made available by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK). The Inline XBRL document based on this entry point must be included in a Report Package together with the annual accounts.

SCOPE (**S**BR **C**reation for **O**ther GAAP **P**ackag**e**) prepares the required Inline XBRL document and combines it with the annual accounts into a Report Package, which can subsequently be filed.

A compiled version of SCOPE can be found in the map 'Program'. The application is signed by the 'Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants'. If specific dll's are needed a complete installation can be found at the releases.
